# üö® DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL BUT NEEDS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

## Your Railway Project: 
https://railway.com/project/e969b7e5-b3a2-4f03-ae12-d5d12c43eab7

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard

Go to your Railway project dashboard (link above) and add these variables:

**Click on your service > Variables tab > Add these:**

```
NODE_ENV=production

JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-change-this-now

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-SUPABASE-PASSWORD]@db.uvafwgdawilbdcsgpryx.supabase.co:5432/postgres

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://lb51563_db_user:[YOUR-MONGO-PASSWORD]@cluster0.i7najps.mongodb.net/my-fit-companion

ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://my-fit-companion-production.railway.app
```

### 2. Replace the passwords:
- [YOUR-SUPABASE-PASSWORD] = Your Supabase database password
- [YOUR-MONGO-PASSWORD] = Your MongoDB Atlas password

### 3. After adding all variables:
The app will automatically redeploy and start working!

## Your App URL (after fixing env vars):
https://my-fit-companion-production.railway.app

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING:
- ‚úÖ Code deployed successfully
- ‚úÖ Docker build completed  
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Prisma client generated

## ‚ùå WHAT NEEDS FIXING:
