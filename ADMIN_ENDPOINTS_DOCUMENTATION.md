- **User**: Added `specialization` and `contactInfo` fields for trainers
- **Exercise**: Added `type` and `caloriesBurned` fields, modified `duration` to be in minutes
- **WorkoutSession**: Added `name` and `imageUrl` fields, made `workoutId` optional

## Error Handling

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes:
- `200 OK` - Successful GET/PUT operations
- `201 Created` - Successful POST operations
- `204 No Content` - Successful DELETE operations
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request data
- `401 Unauthorized` - Missing or invalid authentication
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server errors

Error responses include a descriptive message:
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required fields: name, calories"
}
```

## Testing

A test script is available at `/test-admin-endpoints.js` that can be used to verify all endpoints are working correctly. Update the admin credentials in the script before running:

```bash
node test-admin-endpoints.js
```

## Mobile App Integration

These endpoints are designed to work seamlessly with your Android app's API interface definitions:
- Request/response formats match exactly with your Kotlin data classes
- Field names and types are consistent
- Error handling follows RESTful conventions
- Authentication is handled through JWT tokens

The endpoints are ready for production use and follow the same patterns as your existing admin user management endpoints.
