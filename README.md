## Database Schema

### User Model (Prisma/SQLite)
- Basic user info (email, password, name)
- Physical metrics (height, weight, body fat)
- Fitness goals and preferences
- Role-based permissions

### Exercise & Workout Models
- Exercise library with instructions
- Workout plans with exercise combinations
- Session tracking and completion

### Nutrition Models
- Food database with nutritional info
- Diet plans and meal planning
- Daily nutrition tracking

### Progress & Goals
- Weight and body composition tracking
- Goal setting and achievement
- Progress photos and notes

### Social Models (MongoDB)
- Posts with media support
- Comments and likes system
- Real-time messaging

## Android Integration Considerations

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints optimized for mobile
- JSON responses with consistent structure
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination for large datasets

### Authentication
- JWT tokens for stateless auth
- Token refresh mechanism
- Secure password requirements

### File Uploads
- Image upload for progress photos
- Profile picture support
- Exercise demonstration videos

### Push Notifications
- Workout reminders
- Goal achievements
- Social interactions
- Coach messages

### Offline Support
- Cache workout data
- Sync progress when online
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Recommended Additions

### 1. File Upload Service
```javascript
// Add multer for file uploads
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });
```

### 2. Push Notifications
```javascript
// Add Firebase Cloud Messaging
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
```

### 3. Email Service
```javascript
// Add nodemailer for email notifications
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
```

### 4. Data Validation
```javascript
// Add joi or express-validator
const joi = require('joi');
```

### 5. Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Add express-rate-limit
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
```

### 6. API Documentation
```javascript
// Add swagger for API docs
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');
```

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
```javascript
// Add winston for logging
const winston = require('winston');
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Database
- Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production
- Set up MongoDB Atlas for social features
- Implement proper database backups

### Security
- Environment variable management
